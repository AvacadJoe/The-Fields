You: This flashlight brings back memories of camping in the woods.
You: Sitting around a campfire with my friends, sharing stories while the stars twinkled overhead.
You: I loved that feeling of being together with all of them.  I was so sad when they all moved away.
You: But I remember we all came back to those woods together, every year.  Those times kept me going through the rest of it all.
