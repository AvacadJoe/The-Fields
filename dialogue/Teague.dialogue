Teague: Greetings!
You: Hey there, what are you doing?
Teague: I've been trying to figure it all out. The afterlife, I mean.  So I've been searching through these woods for anything interesting.
Teague: Now I'm pondering these ruins.  These columns must have been here for an awfully long time to be so eroded.
Teague: Then again, it never stops raining, so perhaps that increases the factors of erosion?  I'll have to wait here a few hundred more years and test my hypothesis.
You: See anything else interesting out there?
Teague: I think I saw something that might be of interest to you under the tallest tree in the forest.
You: Thanks!
