You: What are you all doing out here in the woods?
Eva: We all found each other in this clearing and decided we'd prefer each other's company.
Eva: We sort of float around, and tell each other stories of things we still remember from our lives. It's a nice way to pass the time.
You: That sounds... nice actually.
Eva: You're welcome to stay for a while if you'd like.
